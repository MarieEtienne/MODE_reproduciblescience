# II - Spatial series

Spatial relationships are multidirectional and multilateral. They are distinct, in this sense, from temporal relationships, which allow only sequential relationships along the past-present-future axis.

## **I - Codyfing the neighbour structure**

### **1.1) Defining neighbours**

#### **1.1.1) Characteristics of the relationships between spatial objects**

Consider a surface ℜ. This surface can be divided into n mutually exclusive zones. Two adjacent zones are separated by a common boundary.

## Mathematical definition of spatial relationships

Spatial relationships $B$ are a subset of the Cartesian product $ℝ²× ℝ² = {(i, j) : i ∈ ℝ ², j ∈ ℝ²}$ of couples $(i, j)$ of spatial objects, i.e. all couples $(i, j)$ such that $i$ and $j$ are both spatial objects identified by their geographical coordinates, and such that $(i, j)$ is different from $(j,i)$. A spatial object cannot be linked to itself: $(i,i) ⊈ B$. Moreover, if $(i, j) ⊆ B$ and $(j,i) ⊆ B$ for all couples of spatial objects, the spatial relationships are said to be symmetrical (Tiefelsdorf 1998).
:::

Figure 1 illustrates the codifying process of spatial relationships. This approach makes it possible to systematically transcribe the complexity of geographic space into a final set of data analysable by a computer.

![**Figure 1 :** Codifying spatial correlation (Tiefelsdorf, 1998)](C:/Users%5Calexa%5Cgit%5CMODE_reproduciblescience%5CSpatial%20autocorrelation_%20modelisation%5CFigure%201.png)

First, the study zone is divided into mutually exclusive areas. Each area contains a reference point (often its centroid). Then, the spatial relationships can be specified by a neighbourhood graph connecting the areas considered to be neighbouring, or by a matrix containing the geographical coordinates of the reference points. The third step consists in coding the graph in a neighbourhood matrix, or transforming the geographic coordinates into a distance matrix.

The neighborhood matrix measures the similarity between observations. A value greater than zero indicates that the observations are considered neighbors. For example, in the case of the binary matrix shown in figure 1 :

![](images/image-232123009.png){width="470" height="59"}

Conversely, the distance matrix measures dissimilarity between zones. The higher $d_{ij}$ , the more different the zones. With, if an Euclidian distance is used : $d_{ij}=\sqrt{(x_i-x_j )^2+(y_i-y_j )²}$, $α$ and $β$ being the geographical coordinates of the observations. The spatial dependence structure may not be geographical. Any relevant dual relationship may be used to define a neighbourhood graph. For instance:

-   Genetic proximity between families

**The "list of neighbours" object in R**

| Package *spdep* makes it possible to define the relationships between spatial objects. In R, the class of an object defines all its properties and how the statistician can use it. Neighbourhood relationships are recorded in an object of class nb. Assume n spatial observations and `neighbours_nb` the spatial object containing the associated neighbourhood relationships. `neighbours_nb` is a list of length n. Each element `[i]` of the list contains a vector with the index of the neighbours of the item indexed i. If `[i]` does not have neighbours, the list contains only 0. The list also contains a vector of characters corresponding to the attributes of each neighbourhood zone, as well as a logical value indicating whether the relationship is symmetrical (see Figure 2). The main information about the object `neighbours_nb` can be derived using the function: `summary(neighbours_nb)`

Let's load a few packages useful for analysis :

```{r}
#  Spatial series analysis : packages

#Libraries for spatial series analyses
library(spdep) #to extracted the neighbors is a spatial data
library(ade4)  #used for plotting spatial data
library(spatialreg) #used for spatial data modelling
library(gwrr)  #to run geographically weighted regression
#these two libraries (spdep and ade4 also provive function that make object compatibles between library)
```

Let's then begin the analysis of a dataset dealing with richness of birds from agricultural habitats and of plant species from permanent pastures at the scale of Ille-et-Vilaine, "div35".

```{r}
#Spatial series analysis : dataset div35
#For a REGULAR configuration of points 

#      0 - Exporing the dataset 

#Investigate the data set of plant and bird richness at the scale of Ille-et-Vilaine

#Import dataset

#Summary
summary(div35)

#Plot the spatial distribution of the points
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(div35[,3:4])

#This is a map of Ille-et-Vilaine department.
#We can point St-Malo in the North and Rennes in the center for of the map, for example.

#The spatial configuration of the points is regular.
```

**1.2. Connection among neighbours**

In order to identify points in close proximity, it is imperative to establish specific criteria beyond merely considering distance along the x-axis. This approach will enable us to clearly define the parameters that determine proximity between points in our analysis.

**Define Connection Criteria**: We establish criteria for connections, determining that point A is connected to point B, which in turn is connected to point C, and so forth. This linkage needs to be translated into a numerical value, providing a quantitative measure of connectivity.

**Transform Information into Numerical Value:** The established connection criteria are converted into numerical values, creating a quantifiable representation of the relationships between points. This numerical transformation is crucial for subsequent analyses.

**Calculate Autocorrelation Coefficient:** Utilizing the numerical values derived from the connection criteria, we compute an autocorrelation coefficient. This statistical measure helps quantify the degree of spatial autocorrelation, providing insights into the patterns of similarity or dissimilarity among neighboring points.

**Integrating Spatial Autocorrelation into Analyses:** Upon detecting spatial autocorrelation, the next step involves seamlessly integrating this information into our analytical processes. This will be discussed later in this chapter.

**1.2.1 Neighborhood criterion**

**a) Defining neighbours based on distance**

Once we have a set of points spread across the territory, we can calculate the distance between them. These points may be specific locations where the information has been observed, or points representative of each zone, for example their centroid. In this case, the underlying assumption is that the distribution of the variable within each zone is sufficiently homogeneous to approximate it to a single point.

Neighbourhood graphs materialise the links between the various entities. They are defined in such a way that they represent the underlying spatial structure as closely as possible. There exists many different types of neighbourhood graphs.

**a.1) Neighbourhood graphs based on geometric concepts :**

• **Delaunay's Triangulation** Delaunay's Triangulation is a geometric method that connects points into triangles such that the minimum angle of all triangles is maximised.

![**Figure :** Delaunay triangle (source : Pascaline Le Gouar)](images/image-1235549498.png){width="190"}

• **Sphere-of-influence based graph** The sphere-of-influence based graph links two points if their "circles from the nearest neighbour" overlap. The "circle of the nearest neighbour" of point P is the largest circle centred in P and that contains no other points than P. All points in the study set are not necessarily interconnected.

![**Figure :** The sphere of influence graph (edges) of a set of points, showing their nearest neighbour circles (source : Toussaint & Emirates, 2014)](images/image-1767308128.png){width="361"}

• **Gabriel's graph** Gabriel's graph links two points $pi$ and $pj$ if and only if all other points are outside the circle with diameter $[pi, pj ]$.

![**Figure :** Gabriel graph (source : Pascaline Le Gouar)](images/image-1231590752.png){width="227"}

• **Graph of relative neighbours** The graph of relative neighbours considers that two points $pi$ and $pj$ are neighbours if $$d(p_i,p_j) ≤ max [d(p_i,p_k),d(p_j,p_k)] \,\,\,\,\,\,∀k = 1,..., n k\ne i,j$$ with $d(p_i, p_j)$ the distance between $p_i$ and $p_j$.

![**Figure :** Graph of relative neighbours (source : J. O'Rourke, 1982)](images/image-1901385633.png){width="304"}

For example, here's the application of these geometric concepts to Parisian districts :

![**Figure :** Four neighbourhood graphs of Parisian districts based on geometric concepts](images/image-691203873.png){width="610"}

**a.2) Neighbourhood graphs based on nearest neighbours**

A second method consists in selecting the k closest points as neighbours. This method has the advantage that it leaves no point without a neighbour, which is not required when conducting a spatial analysis, but generally offers a better reflection of reality. The choice can also be made to keep only the points located at a certain distance.

For example :

-   Nearest neighbour

-   Two nearest neighbour

-   Three nearest neighbour

-   Neighbours at a minimum distance

    etc

Still using the example of Parisian districts, here's the nearest neighbour application: ![Figure : Four graphs based on the nearest neighbours of Parisian districts](images/image-1634475889.png)

**b) Defining neighbours based on contiguity**

When the areal data consist in a partition of the entire territory, the concept of "distance between observations" can become quite ambiguous. The example below illustrates the limits of using the distance between centroids to define the notion of neighbourhood.

::: callout-note
##### Example - Ambiguity of the notion of distance between centroids

Let $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$ be three distinct zones. It can be considered that since $R_2$ and $R_3$ are separated in space, but both are adjacent to $R_1$, they are both closer to $R_1$ than to one another. However, the centroids in these zones are equidistant from each other (see Figure ). Summarising the proximity between zones by the distance between the centroids results in a partial loss of the richness of the spatial relationships.

![**Figure** - Left: three zones - Right: distance between centroids (Source: Smith, 2016)](images/image-2131022957.png){width="579"}
:::

**Types of contiguity :**

-   **Rook contiguity**

    In the sense of Rook contiguity, neighbours have at least two common boundary points (a segment). This matches the movement of the Rook in chess.

![**Figure :** Rook configuration (source : Pascaline Le Gouar)](images/image-1114536119.png){width="211"}

-   **Queen contiguity**

    For two zones to be adjacent in the sense of Queen contiguity, they only need to share one common boundary point. This matches the movement of the Queen in chess.

![Figure : Queen configuration (source : Pascaline Le Gouar)](images/image-594369851.png)

-   **Bishop contiguity** In the sense of bishop contiguity, two regions are considered as spatial neighbors if they meet at one point ;it is based on the existence of common vertices between two spatial units. This matches the movement of the Bishop in chess.

![**Figure :** Bishop configuration](images/image-2117709373.png){width="177"}

Still using the example of Paris districts, here's an example of how continuity can be applied:

![**Figure :** Queen and Rook contiguity in Paris districts](images/image-351519621.png){width="474"}

We can return to our previous dataset to investigate the configuration of the points :

```{r}
#Spatial series analysis : connexion between points
#For a regular configuration of points

#      1 - Examine the connection between points ====================

# To investigate the various criteria of connection between points we need to
# extract the coordinates in a separate object
xy=div35[,3:4]

#             A - If we choose that points are connected to their 4th nearest neighbors (the "rook connection") ----
div.knear4<-knearneigh(as.matrix(xy),4) #to extract the neighbour points
div.knear4

knn2nb(div.knear4) #knn2nb convert the object returned by the function knearneigh to a class nb (necessary for the subsequent function)
# The information printed corresponds to all the links that have been created compared to all those that could have been created (272)

knn2nb(div.knear4)  # transformation to get as many lists than points/observation
plot(knn2nb(div.knear4), xy, add=TRUE)


#             B - If we specify a queen type of connection with points connected to their 8th nearest neighbors (the "queen connection") ----
div.knear8<-knearneigh(as.matrix(xy),8)
div.knear8
knn2nb(div.knear8)

# Plotting the connection between points for each criterion

par(mfrow=c(1,2))

ade4::s.label(xy, ylim=c(min(div35[,4])-10000,max(div35[,4])+10000), xlim=c(min(div35[,3])-10000,max(div35[,3])+10000),  clabel=0.6, cpoint=1,neig=nb2neig(knn2nb(div.knear4)))
ade4::s.label(xy, ylim=c(min(div35[,4])-10000,max(div35[,4])+10000), xlim=c(min(div35[,3])-10000,max(div35[,3])+10000),  clabel=0.4, cpoint=1,neig=nb2neig(knn2nb(div.knear8)))
#Be careful, the distance between points is not always 10km !
```

**c) Defining neighbours based on the optimisation of a trajectory**

### **1.2 Neighborhood weights**

#### **1.2.1) From a list of neighbours to a weight matrix**

Once the neighbourhood graph has been defined and codified into a list of neighbours, the link between points $i$ and $j$ is transformed into the element $w_{ij}$ of the weight matrix $W$. The weight matrix $W$ is the "formal expression of spatial dependency between observations" (Anselin et al. 1988)\
Formally, the weights express the neighbor structure between the observations as a $n\times n$ matrix $W$ in which the elements $w_{ij}$ of the matrix are the spatial weights:

![](images/image-672436714.png){width="285"}

**Defining the weight matrix**

Most commonly, the weight matrix is a binary contiguity matrix (see Figure ):

> ![](images/image-562063019.png){width="431"}

![Figure – Binary weight matrix](images/image-497770688.png)

Let's go back to our previous data set :

    ```{r}
    #Spatial series analysis : weight matrix

    # about the code : 
    # nb2neig(knn2nb()) transform the matrix to subsequently use it is ade4
    # neig= define the connection matrix between points

    #             Transform the list of the names of the neighbors to a 2 by 2 matrix of neighboors with "0" and "1" -----
    w2<-knn2nb(div.knear4)
    str(w2)                     # we have as much list as points
    nb2neig(knn2nb(div.knear4)) # these lists are transformed in a 2D matrix with 0 or 1.
    ```

The weight matrices can also take into account the **distance** between the geographical zones, as relationships becoming smaller with distance: $1$ if $d < d_0 - 0$ otherwise, $\frac{1}{d^α}$ , or $e^{−αd}$ with $α$ an estimated or predetermined parameter. Using a maximum distance beyond which $w_{ij} = 0$ makes it possible to limit the number of components with a value different from zero. When the size of the zones is heterogeneous, this method increases the risk of a considerable variability in the number of neighbours.

Lastly, certain matrices take the **strength of relations** between the zones into account. For example, weight can be defined by $\frac{b^α_{ij}}{d^β_{ij}}$ with $b_{ij}$ a measure of the strength of relationships between zones $i$ and $j$ (which is not necessarily symmetrical), such as the percentage of common boundaries, the total population, the wealth and $d_{ij}$ the distance between the zones.

## **II - Spatial autocorrelation indices**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: callout-note
Spatial autocorrelation indices measure the spatial dependence between values of the same variable in different places in space. The more the observation values are influenced by observation values that are geographically close to them, the greater the spatial correlation.
:::

**3.2 Global measures of spatial autocorrelation**

**3.2.1 Spatial autocorrelation indices**

Calculating the spatial autocorrelation indices is used to answer two questions:

--- Could the values taken by the neighbouring observations have been comparable (or also dissimilar) by mere chance?

--- If not, then we are dealing with a case of spatial autocorrelation. How is this denoted and what is the strength of the said autocorrelation?

To answer the first question, we must test the hypothesis of absence of spatial autocorrelation for a gross variable y.

--- $H_0$: no spatial autocorrelation

--- $H_1$: spatial autocorrelation

To carry out this test, it is necessary to specify the distribution of the variable of interest y, in the absence of spatial autocorrelation (under $H_0$). In this context, statistical inference is generally conducted considering either of the following assumptions:

**Normality hypothesis:** each of the values of the variable, or $yi$, is the result of an independent draw in the normal distribution specific to each geographical area $i$ on which this variable is measured.

**Randomisation hypothesis** The inference over Moran's I is usually conducted under the randomisation hypothesis. The estimated statistic calculated from data is compared with the distribution of the data derived by randomly re-ordering the data -- permutations. The idea is simply that if the null hypothesis is true, then all possible combinations of data are equiprobable. The data observed are then only one of the many outcomes possible. In the case of spatial autocorrelation, the null hypothesis is always that there is no spatial association and the values of the variable are randomly assigned to the spatial units in order to calculate the test statistic. If the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e. if spatial autocorrelation is found, we can then calculate the range of values that governs the spatial autocorrelation index and thus answer the question as to the signals and strength of the spatial autocorrelation: the closest this index is to 1 in absolute value, the greater is the correlation. *This interval depends on the weight matrix and can sometimes vary outside the interval \[−1; 1\], hence the importance of calculating the limits of this interval.*

Very generally speaking, spatial autocorrelation indices are used to characterise the correlation between measures that are geographically similar to a measured phenomenon. If $WY$ is the vector of means of variable $Y$ (where $W$ is the spatial weights matrix) in the neighbourhood of each spatial unit, spatial autocorrelation indices occur as:

$$Corr(Y,WY) = \frac{Cov(Y,WY)}{\sqrt{Var(Y).Var(WY)}}$$

Based on this very general formulation, for quantitative variables, a main indice is used to test for spatial autocorrelation --- the Moran index. The Moran index considers the variances and covariances taking into account the difference between each observation and the average of all observations.

**Moran index**

$$I_W =
\frac{n}{∑_i∑_jw_{ij}}\frac{∑_i∑_jw_{ij}(y_i −\bar{y})(y_j − \bar{y})}{∑_i(y_i −\bar{y})²} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,i\ne{j}$$

--- $H_0$: The neighbours do not **co-vary** in any particular way.

--- $I_W > 0$ =\> positive spatial autocorrelation

As spatial autocorrelation is measured based on a comparison of the value of an individual variable with that of its neighbours, the definition of the neighbourhood will have a significant impact on the measurement of spatial autocorrelation. The larger the planned neighbourhood, the greater the number of neighbours considered, and the greater the probability that their average will be closer to the population's average, which may lead to a relatively low value for spatial autocorrelation.

**Application with R**

| The *spdep* package is used to calculate spatial autocorrelation indices and their significance using function `moran.test`.
| By default, the distribution of the variable of interest under the null hypothesis is derived by randomisation. The `randomisation = FALSE` argument makes it possible to assume that this is a normal distribution.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
## If certain entities do not have neighbours

\|In order for the package functions spdep to accept spatial weight matrices in which certain units do not have neighbours, it is necessary to specify the option: `zero.policy=TRUE`. By default, the size of the matrix is reduced to exclude observations without neighbours. The opposite can be specified with the option: `adjust.n=FALSE`. In this case, the absolute value of the test statistic increases, and the absolute value of its expected maturity and variance decreases (Bivand et al. 2013a).
:::

Two approaches are used to estimate the significance of these indices --- an analytical solution based on the normality hypothesis and a Monte Carlo solution based on the randomisation hypothesis. The analytical solution, used by the `moran.test` function, is based on the assumption that the test statistic asymptotically follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. This is not always the most accurate measure of significance as convergence towards this distribution may depend on the arrangement of the polygons. Instead, the `moran.mc` function can be used, allowing to choose the number of permutations to calculate the simulated distribution of Moran's I. Comparing the significance levels calculated from functions `moran.mc` and `moran.test` makes it possible to ensure the robustness of the conclusions.

> #### Monte Carlo approach to estimating significance
>
> In a Monte Carlo test (a permutation bootstrap test), the attribute values are randomly assigned to polygons in the data set and, for each permutation of the attribute values, a Moran's I value is computed. The output is a sampling distribution of Moran's I values under the (null) hypothesis that attribute values are randomly distributed across the study area. We then compare our observed Moran's I value to this sampling distribution. ![](images/image-318830441.png){width="380"}

**3.2.2 Spatial autocorrelation of categorical variables**

When the variable of interest is not continuous but categorical, the degree of local association is measured by analysing the statistics of the join count (Zhukov 2010). To illustrate the calculation of these statistics, we consider a binary variable representing two colours, White (B) and Black (N) so that a relation can be called White-White, Black-Black or White-Black. It can be seen that:

--- positive spatial autocorrelation occurs if the number of White-Black relations is significantly lower than what would have occurred with random spatial distribution;

--- negative spatial autocorrelation occurs if the number of White-Black relations is significant greater than what would have occurred with random spatial distribution;

--- no positive spatial autocorrelation occurs if the number of White-Black links is approximately identical to what would have occurred with random spatial distribution;

**3.3 Local measures of spatial autocorrelation**

Global statistics are based on the assumption of a spatial stationary process: spatial autocorrelation would be the same throughout space. However, this assumption is all the less realistic as the number of observations is high.

**3.3.2 Local spatial autocorrelation indicators**

Anselin (Anselin 1995) defines *local spatial autocorrelation indicators*. These must measure the intensity and significance of local autocorrelation between the value of a variable in a spatial unit and the value of the same variable in the surrounding spatial units. More specifically, these indicators make it possible to:

--- detect significant groupings of identical values around a particular location (clusters);

--- identify spatial non-stationarity zones, which do not follow the global process.

The Getis and Ord indicators serve only the first of these two objectives. To be considered as local spatial association measures -- (LISA; *Local Indicators of Spatial Association*) -- as defined by Anselin, these indicators must verify the following two properties:

--- for each observation, they indicate the intensity of the grouping of similar -- or opposite in trend -- values around this observation;

--- the sum of local indices on all observations is proportional to the corresponding global index. One of the most used LISA is the local Moran's I.

**Local Moran's I** $$I_i = (y_i −\bar{y})\sum \limits_{\underset{}{j}}w_{ij}(y_j −\bar{y})$$ $$I_W = constante ∗\sum \limits_{\underset{}i}I_i$$

$Ii > 0$ indicates a grouping of similar values (higher or lower than average).

$Ii < 0$ indicates a combination of dissimilar values (e.g. high values surrounded by low values).

For example, with Parisian districts :

![**Figure :** Values of local Moran's I, on Parisian IRIS - Source: INSEE, Localised Tax Revenues System (RFL) 2010](images/image-979262065.png)

**3.3.3 Significance of the local Moran's I**

Significant LISAs are combinations of similar or dissimilar values more marked than what might have been observed based on random spatial distribution. The significance test of each local association indicator is based on a statistic assumed to asymptotically follow a normal distribution under the null hypothesis. If the assumption of normality holds, $z(I_i) = \frac{I−E(I_i)}{\sqrt{Var(I_i)}}∼ N (0,1)$.

To test the validity of the normality assumption of the LISAs under the null hypothesis, several random distributions are simulated in the space of the variable of interest and the local indicators associated with these simulations are calculated.

Several adjustments methods can be used : "bonferroni", "holm", etc.

**3.3.4 Interpretation of local indices**

**In the absence of global spatial autocorrelation**

The LISAs make it possible to identify areas where similar values are significantly grouped. These are areas where the local spatial structure is such that the relations between neighbours are particularly strong.

**In the presence of global spatial autocorrelation**

LISAs indicate areas that have a **particular impact on the global process** (local autocorrelation more pronounced than global autocorrelation), **or, on the contrary, which stand out from it** (lower autocorrelation).

**3.4 Spatio-temporal indices**

It is not unusual for a geolocalised database to have observations raised at different points in time. It may be interesting to understand how a localised phenomenon has spread and evolved in space and time and how it can be linked to the conditions of the environment surrounding it. In this case, it is important to be able to assess how the underlying spatial structures change over different periods of time. On spatiotemporal data, prior graphical exploration of cross-section data (standard Moran's I) can be used to study the existence and change in grouping or dispersion trends that are statistically significantly different from random models. Many recent developments show a growing interest in analysing spatio-temporal data in many areas of research such as physics, meteorology, economics and environmental studies. By extending the Moran index to include time attributes, it becomes possible to calculate global and localized indices that concurrently take into account spatial and temporal auto-correlations. This can also be done on the basis of spatial-temporal risk weighting matrices.
