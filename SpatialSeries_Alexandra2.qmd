# II - Spatial series

Spatial relationships are multidirectional and multilateral. They are distinct, in this sense, from temporal relationships, which allow only sequential relationships along the past-present-future axis.

#2.1) Defining neighbours

#2.1.1) Characteristics of the relationships between spatial objects Consider a surface ℜ. This surface can be divided into n mutually exclusive zones. Two adjacent zones are separated by a common boundary.

**Mathematical definition of spatial relationships :**

Spatial relationships $B$ are a subset of the Cartesian product $ℝ²× ℝ² = {(i, j) : i ∈ 
ℝ
²,  j ∈ 
ℝ

²}$ of couples $(i, j)$ of spatial objects, i.e. all couples $(i, j)$ such that $i$ and $j$ are both spatial objects identified by their geographical coordinates, and such that $(i, j)$ is different from $(j,i)$. A spatial object cannot be linked to itself: $(i,i) ⊈ B$. Moreover, if $(i, j) ⊆ B$ and $(j,i) ⊆ B$ for all couples of spatial objects, the spatial relationships are said to be symmetrical (Tiefelsdorf 1998).

Figure 2 illustrates the codifying process of spatial relationships. This approach makes it possible to systematically transcribe the complexity of geographic space into a final set of data analysable by a computer.

First, the study zone is divided into mutually exclusive areas. Each area contains a reference point (often its centroid). Then, the spatial relationships can be specified by a neighbourhood graph connecting the areas considered to be neighbouring, or by a matrix containing the geographical coordinates of the reference points. The third step consists in coding the graph in a neighbourhood matrix, or transforming the geographic coordinates into a distance matrix.

The neighborhood matrix measures the similarity between observations. A value greater than zero indicates that the observations are considered neighbors. For example, in the case of the binary matrix shown in figure 1 :

$$w_ij = 
\{1 if i and j are spatially linked to each other -
0 otherwise\}
$$
