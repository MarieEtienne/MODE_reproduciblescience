Temporal dependency means that values sampled at a given time can be related to the value sampled before. Therefore, the variable can be correlated to itself, it is **autocorrelation**.

Therefore, we have to test if the temporal relationship exists.

### Stationarity

Stationary processes are characterized by a conservation of the same mean and variance throughout time. *A contrario*, non-stationary processes have a mean and variance that differentiate with time.
