Temporal dependency means that values sampled at a given time can be related to the value sampled before. Therefore, the variable can be correlated to itself, it is **autocorrelation**.

Therefore, we have to test if the temporal relationship exists.

### Stationarity

Stationary processes are characterized by a conservation of the same mean and variance throughout time. 
*A contrario*, non-stationary processes have a mean and variance that differentiate with time.

The

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


and then describe the purpose of your chapter as well as executing R command.


For example a basic summary of a dataset is given by 

```{r}
df <- read.table("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/slopp/ce3b90b9168f2f921784de84fa445651/raw/4ecf3041f0ed4913e7c230758733948bc561f434/penguins.csv", sep = "," , header = TRUE)
```

and produce a graph

```{r}
df %>% ggplot() +
	aes(x=species, y = body_mass_g) +
	geom_boxplot()  
```
