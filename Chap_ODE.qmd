\#**IV. 3-equation system : The Prey-Predator-Superpredator model**

Biotic interactions are complex, requiring the interaction of numerous
parameters. If we take the **Lotka-Volterra** example, it only considers
the **interactions between two species**, prey and predator. It assumes
a constant mortality rate among predators, regardless of prey. However,
**predators are themselves the prey of other super-predators**. Their
mortality rate should therefore depend on the super-predators they
encounter. Thus, the **prey-predator-superpredator** extension of the
Lotka-Volterra model would be a good representation of natural trophic
interactions.

In this case, we considerer a superpredator, a predator an a prey.

A superpredator is an organism that reaches adulthood at the top of the
food chain. Thus, by definition, a superpredator is not the prey of any
other species. The predator is consider to be in the middle of the food
chain and the prey at the bottom.

The model can be written as the following system of differential
equations:

$$ PPS=\begin{cases}\frac{d_x}{d_t}=ax-bxy &\text{Prey} \\ \frac{d_y}{d_t}=-cy+dxy-eyz&\text{Predator} \\ \frac{d_z}{d_t}=-fz+gyz &\text{Superpredator}\end{cases} $$

The model parameters are :

-   *a* : *x* natural growth rate

-   *-f* and *-c* : natural death rate of *y* and *z*

-   The growth rate of y and z depends on the number of prey caught. It
    is modeled by dxy for y and by gyz for z.

-   

    The death rate of *x* and *y* depends on the number of top predators

    :   *y* for *x* and *z* for *y*. It is modeled by -*bxy* for *x* and
        by *-eyz* for y.

This model is only useful for chains of predators. It doesn't take into
account the presence of several predators with different dynamics on the
same prey.

Let's try to solve this system: To do this, the first step is to find
the balance of the model, that is to say the values (x,y,z) so that:

$$\frac{d_x}{d_t}=\frac{d_y}{d_t}=\frac{d_z}{d_t}=0$$

We take our previous systems that we factored:

$$ PPS=\begin{cases}\frac{d_x}{d_t}=x(a-by) &\text{Prey} \\ \frac{d_y}{d_t}=y(dxy-c-ez)&\text{Predator} \\ \frac{d_z}{d_t}=z(gy-f) &\text{Superpredator}\end{cases} $$

The obvious solution is (0,0,0) but is not the only one. Indeed, for the
derivatives to be equal to 0, then we must find the following solution:

$$(a-by)=(gy-f)=(dx-c-ez)=0$$

2.  How to resolve them ?

a)  Analytic solutions An analytic solutions for an ODE is an expression
    that represents the solution using a finite number of elementary
    functions (exponential, logarithmic...). It provides a precise
    mathematical formula that describes the behavior of the solution for
    all values of the independent variable within a certain range.
    Finding general analytical solutions for third-order ODEs can be
    complicated and often depends on the specific form of the equation.
    Sometimes, they may not exist, and in this case numerical methods
    might be more appropriate.

b)  Numerical methods : Introduction to Euler's method & Runge-Kutta The
    choice of numerical method depends on the specific characteristics
    of the ODE system.
