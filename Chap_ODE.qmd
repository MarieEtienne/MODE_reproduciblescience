Quick plan :
  
# ODE 2 equations
  
  Little explanation of what is an ODE 2 equations
Some examples (a listing ?) of applications in ecology
including Lotka-Volterra
--> Focus on Lotka-Volterra : equations and resolution (model) in R code + graphs + 1 or 2 little exercices to understand

## Lotka-Volterra
