# ODE 2 equations


introduction ecology : populations interact, there's often competition...
The outcome of the competition often depends on environmental conditions.

More generally, if we want to quantify the effect of a species over another species... The effect depends of its population size and the level of competitivity of this species.


To formalise interactions, we need modelling.

**ODE 2 equations are typically used in ecology to model the dynamic of 2 populations in interaction.**





The case of Lotka-Volterra :

equations over time
A pair of differential equations
There *can* be a certain point in time where both equations are in equilibrium and the values that are depending on the time remain aproximatively constant.

Why it's useful --> to see that the interactions between populations can create periodic dynamics over time.
                --> to study how biodiversity interacts with parameters such as competition.
