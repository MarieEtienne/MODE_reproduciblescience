Introduce objectifs of the chapter

I. Dynamics systems (definition)

II. Order 1 ODE & definition of ODE

III. Oder 2 ODE

IV. Order 3 ODE
1. Definition
2. Interest of order 3 ODEs in Ecology and examples

In Ecology, third-order ODEs can be used to model systems whose dynamics depend on 3 important factors or processes.

3. Analytic solutions and application to ecological models

An analytic solutions for an ODE is an expression that represents the solution using a finite number of elementary functions (exponential, logarithmic...).
Analytic solutions provide a precise mathematical formula that describes the behavior of the solution for all values of the independent variable within a certain range.


#Add example + analytic solution#

(Transfrom third-order ODE on second-order ODE ?)


Finding general analytical solutions for third-order ODEs can be complicated and often depends on the specific form of the equation.
Sometimes, analytic solutions may not exist, and in this case numerical methods might be more appropriate.

4. Numerical methods to resolve (Euler's method & Runge-Kutta + solving from a real example)
a) Introduction to Euler's method & Runge-Kutta
The choice of numerical method depends on the specific characteristics of the ODE system.

b) How to solve third-order ODE with R ?
