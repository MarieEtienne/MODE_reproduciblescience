VI. Second & Third-order ODE
1. Definition

2. How to resolve them ? 
a) Analytic solutions
An analytic solutions for an ODE is an expression that represents the solution using a finite number of elementary functions (exponential, logarithmic...).
It provides a precise mathematical formula that describes the behavior of the solution for all values of the independent variable within a certain range.
Finding general analytical solutions for third-order ODEs can be complicated and often depends on the specific form of the equation.
Sometimes, they may not exist, and in this case numerical methods might be more appropriate.

b) Numerical methods : Introduction to Euler's method & Runge-Kutta
The choice of numerical method depends on the specific characteristics of the ODE system.
