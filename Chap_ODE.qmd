# ODE 2 equations


introduction ecology : populations interact, there's often competition...
The outcome of the competition often depends on environmental conditions.

More generally, if we want to quantify the effect of a species over another species... The effect depends of its population size and the level of competitivity of this species.


To formalise interactions, we need modelling.

**ODE 2 equations are typically used in ecology to model the dynamic of predator-prey populations.**

But Lotka-Volterra also has applications in microbiology (see https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.36.1.11-17.1978)




The case of Lotka-Volterra :

equations over time
A pair of differential equations
There *can* be a certain point in time where both equations are in equilibrium and the values that are depending on the time remain aproximatively constant.

Why it's useful --> to see that the interactions between populations can create periodic dynamics over time.
                --> to study how biodiversity interacts with parameters such as competition.




## Lotka-Volterra

Typically, here's what these equations can look like :

$$ \frac{dx}{dt}=\alpha x - \beta x y $$
$$ \frac{dx}{dt}=\delta xy - \gamma y $$
It's important to really understand how equations are constructed and what they do before getting started.  
Don't be afraid by the looks of all those letters, we'll gonna break it down to you quite simply:
