## 3 - Saptial modeling

Once the structure of the spatial correlation has be estimated, it can then be included in the model.

Depending on the structure of the autocorrelation and especially if the process is or is not stationary,and of the structure of the residuals, the analysis required will be different and more or less difficult.

### 3.1.Stationary process

For the models described here, it is required for the processes to be stationary, meaning that the process is constant across regions. Another assumption is that the spatial autocorrelation is isotropic. This means that the cause of the autocorrelation act the same way in every direction. Anisotropy may be caused for example by environmental factors like the wind or water currents.

#### 3.1.1. Spatially lagged X model

This model estimate how well the response variable at one site reflect the response values at its surrounding sites. Starting from the usual linear predictor for a generalized linear model :

to which will be added an extra parameter, a distance-weighted function of the neighboring response value, called the autocovariate.

A can be calculated as either the weighted sum :

or as the weighted average:

(*y*j = the value of y at the site j i's set of *k*i neighbors
*w*ij = the weight given to the site j's influence over site i)

This function is usually related to the distance between data points or to the environnemental distance.


#### 3.1.2. - Simultaneous autoregressive models (SAR)

##### 3.1.2.1. Lagrange Multiplier diagnostic

##### 3.1.2.2. Error models

##### 3.1.2.3. Lag models

##### 3.1.2.4. Mixed models

### 3.2. - Non stationary process

**Graphically weighted models (GWM)**

Few methods exist to deal with non stationary processes
